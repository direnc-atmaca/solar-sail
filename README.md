## Solar Sail

This repository contains the codes for the Solar Sail feasibility study performed by Direnc Atmaca for Charles West.

The mission starts from a Low Earth Orbit and ends at the Low Mars Orbit.
The solar sail that does not rely on any impulsive propulsion tools and only utilizes solar radiation pressure to generate thrust.

Files cover three mission stages:
1) Earth Escape Trajectory (EarthCentered.py)
2) Interplanetary Flight around the Sun (Interplanetary.py)
3) Mars Aerobraking (MarsAerobrake.py)

Entire mission is coded on Python and uses several libraries such as Matplotlib and scipy.

Codes include a range of lightness numbers, mass, and surface area. 
However, it is possible to use these files simulate solar sail spacecraft that use different performance parameters.

## Credits

Many thanks to Charles West for allowing me to work on this topic and providing the idea.

This study uses a significant amount of theory from the book "Solar Sailing: Technology, Dynamics and Mission Applications" from Colin R. McInnes.
